# CSE344-Web-Tech-Project1

This is a web-based project developed using Java Servlets and Tomcat 9.

## Project Description

The CSE344-Web-Tech-Project1 is a web application that provides functionality for a student management system. It allows users to register as students or teachers, log in to their respective accounts, and perform various operations based on their roles.

The project includes the following key features:

- User registration: Students and teachers can register for an account using the registration form (`register.jsp`).
- User authentication: The login functionality (`login.jsp`) allows registered users to log in to their accounts securely.
- Role-based access control: Different functionalities are provided based on the user's role (student or teacher).
- Student Dashboard: The student dashboard (`student.jsp`) displays information about the student, such as assignments, grades, etc.
- Teacher Dashboard: The teacher dashboard (`teacher.jsp`) allows teachers to manage students, assign tasks, and view student submissions.
- Error handling: Custom error pages (`error.jsp`) are provided to handle various error scenarios and display appropriate messages to the user.
